        <p>Student in <strong>Business and Marketing</strong>, I am a curious, creative and resourceful person. I get more and more interested by <strong>entrepreneurship, e-commerce and start-up companies</strong> in general, I continuously self-educate thanks to the different available platforms such as YouTube, Koudetat, Coursera etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        I also spent <strong>two years abroad</strong> (Colombia and Australia) in order to improve my language skills.

        In other words, I am a cinema lover. I also do sports, I am open-minded and I bring a lot of fun to my environment.
        </p>

        <H2>Entrepreneurship 👨‍💻</H2>
        <p>I discovered entrepreneurship through YouTube and more specifically with <strong>The Family</strong>. I was very interested in the subject so I started to take it very seriously. I then decide to <strong>do something by myself</strong> so i started by creating my first small business (Les Petits Carrés). After my Master's degree, I would like to <strong>build a big project with some partners</strong>.

        <H2>Swiming 🏊‍♂️</H2>
        <p>I started swimming quite late (17 years old) but I progressed very quickly to reach an almost national level. I recently <strong>go back to competition and intensive training</strong> with my club in Paris. </p>
